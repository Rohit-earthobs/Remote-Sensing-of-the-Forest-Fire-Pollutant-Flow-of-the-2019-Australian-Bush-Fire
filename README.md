# Remote Sensing of the Forest Fire Pollutant Flow of the 2019 Australian Bushfires

## Overview
This project analyzes the spread of forest fire pollutants (FFP) from the 2019 Australian bushfires using remote sensing data. The study focuses on tracking carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), and particulate matter (PM) to understand how pollutants disperse through the atmosphere and impact Earth system processes.

## Objective
To demonstrate the capability of remote sensing and Google Earth Engine (GEE) in detecting, mapping, and tracking forest fire pollutants over time and space.

## Study Area
Eastern Australia, one of the most fire-prone regions globally, dominated by eucalyptus forests prone to recurrent bushfires.

## Methodology
- Collected satellite-based data of CO, NO₂, and PM from the 2019 bushfire events.  
- Processed and visualized the data using Google Earth Engine (GEE).  
- Analyzed pollutant flow patterns based on global wind trajectories and atmospheric dynamics.  
- Evaluated interconnections between fire intensity, pollutant load, and dispersion.

## Tools and Datasets
- Google Earth Engine (GEE)  
- Sentinel-5P (TROPOMI) for CO and NO₂  
- MODIS for fire detection and aerosol data  
- Python / Jupyter Notebook (optional for supporting analysis)

## Key Findings
- Forest fire pollutants exhibited long-range atmospheric transport influenced by global wind patterns.  
- Elevated CO, NO₂, and PM concentrations persisted even after active fire events ended.  
- Remote sensing enables effective pollutant tracking and environmental impact assessment during large-scale fires.
